# test-app-elm-03

This app is a pure Elm frontend talking to an API developed in Ruby on Rails.
The purpose of this project is to develop a Single Page App (SPA) with all CRUD functionality.
As a proof of concept, I am using a simple To-to Model.
The to-do model is nice and represents other typical business apps because it has the same type of fields.
Numbers, Booleans, Strings, Texts, Dates, and a Contexts (Unplanned, Planned, Done, Archived, Deleted)

The five endpoints are

- Index
- Show
- Update
- Create
- Destroy
